- Statistics:
28536 locations, all have hebrew primary names, and of which:
4268 have additional hebrew names (variants, one or more)


- Data feedback (flagged):
To ourselves:
Misc column is completely empty. 
Recommend against using the ‘region’ entities, except אזור the settlement… (filter for אזור and see)
Starred and flagged items need fixing the reconciliation between nli and kima

Entity 000633788 (Tswaing Meteorite Crater) is named מכטש in Hebrew instead of מכתש.
The following entities have << in the beginning of the primary Arab name. What does it mean?-
000976283, 000980445, 000985760, 001005757, 001008755, 001040516, 001040904, 001059751, 005017008. There are also 103 Hebrew primary names that have them and 36 roman(english) names, around the definitive arab article. 
I flagged a few additional apparent errors where a hebrew primary name is actually not hebrew, or where the term ‘region’ is used awkwardly in the primary form

- To Yael
The starred (unflagged)items do not have comma between their hebrew and arab primary names (e.g.
001059751 slovechna seems to be the only item with cyrillic primary form. No arabic primary form. Check - inform the library?
