Recommend against using the ‘region’ entities, except אזור the settlement… (filter for אזור and see)

Entity 000633788 (Tswaing Meteorite Crater) is named מכטש in Hebrew instead of מכתש.
The following entities have << in the beginning of the primary Arab name. What does it mean?-
000976283, 000980445, 000985760, 001005757, 001008755, 001040516, 001040904, 001059751, 005017008. There are also 103 Hebrew primary names that have them and 36 roman(english) names, around the definitive arab article. 
I flagged a few additional apparent errors where a hebrew primary name is actually not hebrew, or where the term ‘region’ is used awkwardly in the primary form
