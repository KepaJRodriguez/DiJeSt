### Locations entities(sinai)
- preliminary Statistics for the locations extracted March 9, 2019:
28536 locations, all have hebrew primary names, and of which:
4268 have additional hebrew names (variants, one or more)


- Data feedback (flagged):
Recommend against using the ‘region’ entities, except אזור the settlement… (filter for אזור and see)
Starred and flagged items need fixing the reconciliation between nli and kima
We removed misc column (was empty)

To the library
* Entity 000633788 (Tswaing Meteorite Crater) is named מכטש in Hebrew instead of מכתש.
* I flagged a few additional apparent errors where a hebrew primary name is actually not hebrew, or where the term ‘region’ is used awkwardly in the primary form
