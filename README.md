#DiJeSt: Digitizing Jewish studies

Supported by Rothschild Foundation Hanadiv Europe, DiJeSt is an incubator for digital humanities work in Jewish studies. 
We are adapting a pipeline of cutting edge tools and platforms which will enable scholars and students to engage in digital projects, profiting and contributing to a collaborative open pool of Jewish studies resources.


With a selection of case study projects and collaborations, tools and tutorials we will share the know how and knowledge that enables empowering and transforming the core activities of the scholar:  Reading, analyzing and disseminating. 

##READ
Optical character recognition (OCR), OCR correction and model training for texts printed in the Hebrew letter in the various Jewish languages. 

##ANALYZE
Extracting information from text, structuring it and connecting it to a network of knowledge on People, Places, Publications and books in Jewish History. 

##DISSEMINATE
Presenting and sharing the data and the knowledge gained from it.
