# DiJeSt: Digitizing Jewish studies

Supported by Rothschild Foundation Hanadiv Europe, DiJeSt is an incubator for digital humanities work in Jewish studies. 
We are adapting a pipeline of cutting edge tools and platforms which will enable scholars and students to engage in digital projects, profiting and contributing to a collaborative open pool of Jewish studies resources.


With a selection of case study projects and collaborations, tools and tutorials we will share the know how and knowledge that enables empowering and transforming the core activities of the scholar:  Reading, analyzing and disseminating. 

## READ
Optical character recognition (OCR), OCR correction and model training for texts printed in the Hebrew letter in the various Jewish languages. We plan to:
### create ground truth with https://transkribus.eu, JOCHRE, Escriptorium
### provide conversions between open access and open source tools to encourage flow of ground truth data ((page.xml, alto(2, 4 and more)

## ANALYZE
Extracting information from text, structuring it and connecting it to a network of knowledge on People, Places, Publications and books in Jewish History. We hope to:
### create tutorials on extracting and structuring information (e.g. with Recogito, using Regular Expressions)
### develop tools for update, correction, linking and addition to the DIJEST LOD repository, and for manual, automated and moderated detection and extraction of data from texts (complementary to Wikidata and recogito, respectively)
 
## DISSEMINATE
Tutorials for visualizing, presenting and sharing the data and the knowledge gained from it.
